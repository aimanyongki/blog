Some useful statistical terms:  
1. Root Mean Square  
The RMS value of a set of values (or a continuous-time waveform) is the square root of the arithmetic mean of the squares of 
the values, or the square of the function that defines the continuous waveform.

The RMS over all time of a periodic function is equal to the RMS of one period of the function. The RMS value of a continuous function or signal can be approximated by taking the RMS of a sample consisting of equally spaced observations.  
In the case of the RMS statistic of a random process, the expected value is used instead of the mean.
