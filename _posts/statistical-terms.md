Some useful statistical terms:  
1. [Root Mean Square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_mean_square)    
The RMS value of a set of values (or a continuous-time waveform) is the square root of the arithmetic mean of the squares of 
the values, or the square of the function that defines the continuous waveform.  
In the case of the RMS statistic of a random process, the expected value is used instead of the mean.  

2. [Standard Deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation)  
is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values.
