Some useful statistical terms:  
1. [Root Mean Square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_mean_square)    
The RMS value of a set of values (or a continuous-time waveform) is the square root of the arithmetic mean of the squares of 
the values, or the square of the function that defines the continuous waveform.  
In the case of the RMS statistic of a random process, the expected value is used instead of the mean.  

2. [Standard Deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation)  
is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values.  

3. [Moving Average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average)  
A moving average (rolling average or running average) is a calculation to analyze data points by creating a series of averages of different subsets of the full data set. It is also called a moving mean (MM)[1] or rolling mean and is a type of finite impulse response filter.  

4. [Exponential smoothing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_smoothing)  
Exponential smoothing is a rule of thumb technique for smoothing time series data using the exponential window function. Whereas in the simple moving average the past observations are weighted equally, exponential functions are used to assign exponentially decreasing weights over time. It is an easily learned and easily applied procedure for making some determination based on prior assumptions by the user, such as seasonality. Exponential smoothing is often used for analysis of time-series data.  

5. [Window function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_function)  
A window function (also known as an apodization function or tapering function[1]) is a mathematical function that is zero-valued outside of some chosen interval, normally symmetric around the middle of the interval, usually near a maximum in the middle, and usually tapering away from the middle.  

6. [Errors and residuals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors_and_residuals)  
Errors and residuals are two closely related and easily confused measures of the deviation of an observed value of an element of a statistical sample from its "theoretical value". The error (or disturbance) of an observed value is the deviation of the observed value from the (unobservable) true value of a quantity of interest (for example, a population mean), and the residual of an observed value is the difference between the observed value and the estimated value of the quantity of interest (for example, a sample mean). The distinction is most important in regression analysis, where the concepts are sometimes called the regression errors and regression residuals and where they lead to the concept of studentized residuals.
