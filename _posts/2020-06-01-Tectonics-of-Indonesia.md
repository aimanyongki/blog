# Tectonics of Indonesia

The skype session with my supervisor make me think about what I am gonna do for my PhD journey. I am just about to start my 4-year prae doc program at the University of Vienna. I most likely will doing something with Ambient Seismic Tomography. One thing that quite tempting is to understand Indonesian Tectonics using this promising method.
