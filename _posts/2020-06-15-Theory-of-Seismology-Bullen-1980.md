Following an actual earthquake, the displacement of any point of the Earth's surface is markedly different from waves through only a homogeneous medium. There are oscillatory movements being due to one or more of the following causes:  
(i)   the existence of more complicated initial conditions  
(ii)  fluctuations in the local gravity value during the passage of disturbance  
(iii) imperfections of elasticity  
(iv)  departures from homogeneity within the Earth  

In regard to (i), the initial dislocation of material causing the earthquake would normally be spread over a finite interval of time. If there were several distinct movements during this interval, it would be independent of the distance of the point from source of the disturbances.  

The effect of gravity fluctuations is also can be neglected as the gravity term has no effect in the propagation os S waves. This is an immediate consequence of the fact that a purely rotational disturbance causes no disturbance in density. Therefore the neglect of gravity effects is unimportant in all ordinary problems on seismological bodily waves. In particular, these effects cannot account for the observed dispersion of these waves.

If we consider several cases other than perfect elasticity assumption (elastic after working, the Jeffreys-Lomnitz law, elasticoviscosity), the onset of a pulse is also sharp as in the perfect elasticity case; and there is no dispersion introduced.

It emerges that the essenial cause of the observed oscillatory movements must be sought in (iv) heterogeneity of the Earth.
